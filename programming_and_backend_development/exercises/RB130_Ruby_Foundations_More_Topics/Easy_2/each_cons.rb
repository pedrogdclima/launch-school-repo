The Enumerable#each_cons method iterates over the members of a collection taking each sequence of n consecutive elements at a time and passing them to the associated block for processing. It then returns a value of nil.

Write a method called each_cons that behaves similarly for Arrays, taking the elements 2 at a time. The method should take an Array as an argument, and a block. It should yield each consecutive pair of elements to the block, and return nil.

Your method may use #each, #each_with_object, #each_with_index, #reduce, loop, for, while, or until to iterate through the Array passed in as an argument, but must not use any other methods that iterate through an Array or any other collection.

def each_cons(array)
  array.each_with_index do |element, index|
    break if index + 2 > array.size
    yield(element, array[index + 1])
  end
  nil
end

hash = {}
result = each_cons([1, 3, 6, 10]) do |value1, value2|
  hash[value1] = value2
end
p result == nil
p hash == { 1 => 3, 3 => 6, 6 => 10 }

hash = {}
result = each_cons([]) do |value1, value2|
  hash[value1] = value2
end
p hash == {}
p result == nil

hash = {}
result = each_cons(['a', 'b']) do |value1, value2|
  hash[value1] = value2
end
p hash == {'a' => 'b'}
p result == nil

=begin
In the previous exercise, we wrote a method that emulates Enumerable#each_cons, but limited our method to handling 2 elements at a time. Enumerable#each_cons can actually handle any number of elements at a time: 1, 2, 3, or more.

Update your each_cons method so it takes an argument that specifies how many elements should be processed at a time.

Your method may use #each, #each_index, #each_with_object, #reduce, loop, for, while, or until to iterate through the Array passed in as an argument, but must not use any other methods that iterate through an Array or any other collection.

def each_cons(array, number)
  array.each_with_index do |element, index|
    break if index + number -1 >= array.size
    yield(element, *array[(index + 1)..(index + number - 1)])
  end
  nil
end

hash = {}
each_cons([1, 3, 6, 10], 1) do |value|
  hash[value] = true
end
p hash == { 1 => true, 3 => true, 6 => true, 10 => true }

hash = {}
each_cons([1, 3, 6, 10], 2) do |value1, value2|
  hash[value1] = value2
end
p hash == { 1 => 3, 3 => 6, 6 => 10 }

hash = {}
each_cons([1, 3, 6, 10], 3) do |value1, *values|
  hash[value1] = values
end
p hash == { 1 => [3, 6], 3 => [6, 10] }

hash = {}
each_cons([1, 3, 6, 10], 4) do |value1, *values|
  hash[value1] = values
end
p hash == { 1 => [3, 6, 10] }

hash = {}
each_cons([1, 3, 6, 10], 5) do |value1, *values|
  hash[value1] = values
