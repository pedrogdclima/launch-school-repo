At the end of this course, it's a good idea to build one or two more small Sinatra applications on your own to help solidify your understanding of the concepts we've covered in this course. Here are some ideas for what you could build:

A contact list application that tracks contacts and their names, phone numbers, and email addresses. To add more complexity, assign contacts to categories (friends, family, work, etc).
A flight tracking application that allows a user to enter the airline, flight number, destination, and departure time for a flight.
A monthly budget application that tracks bills, categories or expenses, and provides totals by month or year.
An application that tracks team names and members, for sports or other activities.
A survey application that asks a set of questions and persists the answers for display in a report. To add more complexity, responses could be stored in files based on the current time (to avoid collisions).
A simple version of any site you use on a daily basis.
An online version of one of the games we wrote in RB101 and RB120.
Some things to think about while you work:

Store data in a user's session or a file
Add validations to validate values submitted via forms
Keep shared content in a layout
