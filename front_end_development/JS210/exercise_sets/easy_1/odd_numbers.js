// Log all odd numbers from 1 to 99, inclusive, to the console, with
// each number on a separate line.

for (let idx = 1; idx < 100; idx += 2) {
  console.log(idx);
}

// Further Exploration
// Repeat this exercise with a technique different from the one that you
// used, and different from the one provided. Also consider adding a way
// for the user to specify the limits of the odd numbers logged to the
// console.
