=begin
Create a method that takes an array of numbers as an argument. For each number, determine how many numbers in the array are smaller than it, and place the answer in an array. Return the resulting array.

When counting numbers, only count unique values. That is, if a number occurs multiple times in the array, it should only be counted once.

p smaller_numbers_than_current([8, 1, 2, 2, 3]) == [3, 0, 1, 1, 2]
p smaller_numbers_than_current([7, 7, 7, 7]) == [0, 0, 0, 0]
p smaller_numbers_than_current([6, 5, 4, 8]) == [2, 1, 0, 3]
p smaller_numbers_than_current([1]) == [0]

my_array = [1, 4, 6, 8, 13, 2, 4, 5, 4]
result   = [0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 2]
p smaller_numbers_than_current(my_array) == result

The above tests should each print true.
