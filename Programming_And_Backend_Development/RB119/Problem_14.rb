=begin
Create a method that takes a single integer argument and returns the sum of all the multiples of 7 or 11 that are less than the argument. If a number is a multiple of both 7 and 11, count it just once.

For example, the multiples of 7 and 11 that are below 25 are 7, 11, 14, 21, and 22. The sum of these multiples is 75.

If the argument is negative, return 0.

The test below should each print true.
=end

p seven_eleven(10) == 7
p seven_eleven(11) == 7
p seven_eleven(12) == 18
p seven_eleven(25) == 75
p seven_eleven(100) == 1153
p seven_eleven(0) == 0
p seven_eleven(-100) == 0
